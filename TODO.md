# Bugs / Missing

- [ ] Zooming fcks up mouse click events -> positions are wrong
- [ ] When board is not full window, click & drag calculations are wrong
- [ ] Touchscreens not working

- Add some sort of click event hijacking and adjust cursor to scaled position
- ON bounded -> window resize -> fix view jump
- fix scrolling trackpag nested scrolls
- when not fullscreen, window.innerwidth does not apply --> Replace with getting parent bounding box
