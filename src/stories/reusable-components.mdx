# Reusable Components

In a real world application you probably want to have a reusable component which represents a "card" or sth. like that on your board.
This component will be responsibe for using the necessarry tela components (Positionable, Draggable...) so that you can use it without having to re-implement all of that each time.

The following example shows how a simple reusable component could look like. This basic card is also included in the tela library to start with.
